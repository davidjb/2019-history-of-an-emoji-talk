Notes:
* Why the joy emoji was Oxford dictionary's word of the year in 2015
* Yes, seriously

## U+FFFD

Notes:
* I'm going to cover one specific emoji
* But which one?
* Btw, not an emoji, that's the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER
* You'll see that when a Unicode character isn't able to be displayed on your
  device (eg new emoji on an old device)

## 絵文字

Notes:
* Brief history
* Emoji literally means "e" (picture) + "moji" (character)
* Naming similarity with emotion/emoticon is complete coincidence
* First emoji set on a Japanese phone in 1997
* Wider set created by telco NTT DoCoMo in 1999 (show original art)

---

![original emoji](img/original-emoji.jpg) <!-- .element class="plain stretch"-->

Notes:
* 176 chars, 12x12 grid, completely non-standard
* Now a **MUSEUM piece** with MoMA in NYC!
* Anyway, telcos in Japan started to compete
* FF a bit and who's better at marketing than anyone?

# 🍏

Notes:

* Apple's appeal to Japanese market lead to inclusion of a then-non
  standard emoji keyboard
* Hidden from English-speaking markets
* People found it, used it and Apple realised the cultural importance
* In other words...

Notes:
* Now: we have a growing set of standardised characters as part of the Unicode standard

### MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING
#### Unicode: U+1F574

Notes:
* Introduced in Unicode 7.0 in 2014
* AKA "man in suit levitating"
* But why is it so?
* Well, turns out the Unicode Consortium noted that Wingdings and Webdings
  were in common usage given their prevalence from MS Windows
* They decided to include **ALL** the glyphs not already part of Unicode

---

![webdings version](img/businessman-levitating-webdings.svg) <!-- .element class="plain logo" -->

Notes:
* Webdings version
* Webdings was created in 1997
* Shipped with Internet Explorer 4.0 and with Windows 98 onwards
* But why is it so?

---

![webdings](img/webdings.png) <!-- .element class="plain stretch img-limit"-->

Notes:
* Webdings has 230 characters, stuff Microsoft's designers thought "useful"
* Vincent Connare, designer of Comic Sans, is the one responsible

---

# "jump" <!-- .element style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';" -->

Notes:
* The word "jump" was on the list of symbols that Vincent was perusuing so see
  what he'd be interested in working on
* He thought "Jump" equals "jupming, pogo-ing man"
* He had a ska-genre Japanese import CD by a band called "The Specials", whose
  record label logo was on it...

---

![specials CD](img/specials-album-cover.jpg) <!-- .element class="plain stretch img-limit"-->

Notes:
* Look familiar?
* This is part of the 2 Tone Records logo, and it appeared across their
  label's artists from 1979 to 1985
* On the left is our boy - he was named "Walt Jabsco"
* Came from a charity shop American bowling shirt the label's founder
  purchased -- and "Walt Jabsco" was embroidered on the shirt
* Anyway: **"Rude boy" style**, British Ska -- black suit, white shirt, tie, pork pie hat & loafters
* But why is it so?

# 🕴

Notes:
* Well, and finally, here's the inspiration
* The album artwork of a reggae band from the mid-60s called the Wailing
  Wailers
* The gent on the right is Peter Tosh, and the label chose him,
  describing the look as "Defiant & Jamaican & Hard"

---

# 👨🏿‍🎤➕🎵➕🎳👕➕💻➕🕸➕⏳=🕴

Notes:
* So there you go.
* Reggae, ska music, a bowling shirt, IE 4.0, Windows 98, the web and a whole
  lotta time equals our new friend

---

# 🕴🕴🏻🕴🏼🕴🏽🕴🏾🕴🏿

Notes:
* And now we have skin tone colours too
* Added in Unicode 8.0 in 2015
* No gendered version yet but some non-standard versions have appeared
